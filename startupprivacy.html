                        <p>This Privacy Policy applies to all users of our Website, related mobi-sites and software applications, collectively referred to as “our Platforms”, which are used to access and purchase our products and services.</p>
                        <p>
                            Privacy Policy

                        Our app is committed to protecting the privacy of our users. We understand the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of your personal information and we have implemented appropriate measures to safeguard it. This privacy policy explains how we collect, use, and disclose your personal information.

                        
                        <p><b>Collection of Personal Information</b></p>

                        When using MrDocs, you may be required to provide personal information, such as your name and ID document. This information is used to verify your identity when requested by a company. To further increase the security of the verification process, we collect face data in the form of a selfie photo. This photo is compared with the photo on your ID document to confirm that you are indeed the owner of the ID.

                        The face data collected is used solely for the purpose of facial recognition and is not stored on our servers. Instead, we use Amazon Rekognition API, a highly secure and reliable facial recognition service, to process and compare the photos.

                        
                        <p><b>Storage of Personal Data</b></p>

                        We understand the importance of data security and take steps to protect your personal information. We do not store face data and only retain the selfie photo for future reference. The photo is stored in an encrypted format to ensure that it cannot be accessed by unauthorized parties.

                        <p><b>Use of Personal Information</b></p>

                        We use your personal information to provide you with the services offered by our app, such as document signing and connecting with investors. We also use your personal information to improve our app and to communicate with you about updates and new features.

                        
                        <p><b>Disclosure of Personal Information</b></p>
                        
                        We do not disclose your personal information to any third parties without your consent, except in the following cases:

                        <p>To comply with a legal request or court order</p>
                        <p>To protect the rights or property of our app or our users</p>
                        <p>To enforce our terms of service</p>

                        <p><b>Security of Personal Information</b></p>
                        

                        We take appropriate measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. We also regularly review our security practices and update them as necessary.

                        
                        <p><b>Changes to Privacy Policy</b></p>

                        We may update this privacy policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. We will notify you of any changes by posting the updated policy on our app.
