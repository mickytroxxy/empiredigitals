Introduction
The governing law for the Terms of Service is the law of Sout Africa, irrespective of your current location or jurisdiction when accessing the fasthire Application.
Fastcarhire is a platform for peer-to-peer car rental; this is provided by Betterdays  Technologies Pty Ltd ("Fastcarhire", "we", "us" or "our"). Fastcarhire provides a Service which allows Owners to create a listing for their Vehicles and allows Renters to find out information about which Vehicles are available for rental. The Service provides a platform for Renters to book directly with Owners.
These Terms of Service ("Terms") describe the Terms and Conditions that govern the use of and participation in Fastcarhire and its Services.
Fastcarhire's Services include our mobile device software application and any other mobile or online services and/or applications owned, controlled, or offered by Fastcarhire (collectively known as "Service"). By accessing or using the Service, you signify that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms and to the collection and use of your information as set forth in the Fastcarhire Privacy Policy.
This legal notice applies to the entire contents of this booking engine. Please take the time to read these Terms of Service ('Terms') as by using this booking engine you indicate your acceptance of these Terms of Service. If you do not accept these terms, you are advised not to use this booking engine. By using any part of Fastcarhire's booking engine, you shall be deemed to have accepted this legal notice in its entirety.
Fastcarhire reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify the Service or to modify these Terms, including the Service Fees, at any time and without prior notice. If we modify these Terms, we will either post the modification on the Site or via the Application or otherwise provide you with notice of the modification. We will also update the "Last Updated" date at the top of these Terms. By continuing to access or use the Service after we have posted a modification on the Site or via the Application or have provided you with notice of a modification, you are indicating that you agree to be bound by the modified Terms. If the modified Terms are not acceptable to you, your only recourse is to cease using the Site, Application and Services.
It is important to note Fastcarhire is not a party to the rental agreement between Owner and Renter, and Fastcarhire does not have any control over, and is not responsible for the actions or conduct of either the Owner or the Renter.

The Owner agrees to cooperate with and assist Fastcarhire in good faith (including responding promptly to communications) and provide Fastcarhire with such information and take such actions as may be reasonably requested by Fastcarhire in connection with any complaints, claims, charges or notices relating to the Owner’s Vehicle and listing.
The Owner, not Fastcarhire, is solely responsible for honouring any confirmed booking requests and making the Vehicle available to satisfy the booking request.
When making a booking, the Renter should rely solely on the information provided on the Fastcarhire App and Site, and any additional information communicated by the Owner to the Renter. Fastcarhire may endeavour to provide additional information about the Vehicle upon request from the Renter, but it will not assume any liability for the accuracy or completeness of any such information.
Fastcarhire has the right to investigate and prosecute violations of any of the above to the fullest extent of the law. In addition, and as set in these Terms, Fastcarhire may take a range of actions against you, including but not limited to deactivating or cancelling your Listing(s) or Fastcarhire Account, for a violation of this Section or these Terms.
Third Party Links
This booking engine may contain links to resources located on servers or websites operated by parties other than Fastcarhire. If you use these links you will leave the booking platform (website, mobile application). Such hyperlinks are provided for your reference and convenience only.
The inclusion of hyperlinks on this booking platform to other websites or servers do not imply any endorsement of the material on such websites or servers (including but not limited to material relating to travel information or services) or any association with their operators.
Fastcarhire does not control and is not responsible for such websites or the servers or the parties operating such websites or servers and accordingly Fastcarhire accepts no responsibility or liability for any material contained on those servers or websites, or the accuracy or legality of information contained on other websites or servers.
You will need to use your own discretion when communicating and utilising services from these other websites or servers. If you decide to access any of the third party websites linked to the mobile platform application, or website, you do so entirely at your own risk.
Fees, Billing, Payments
You agree to the fees and charges, terms of sale, payment and billing policies applicable to your use of the Service as stated within the mobile application. Fastcarhire may add new services for additional fees and charges, or amend fees and charges for existing services, at any time in its sole discretion.
Payments. Fastcarhire has sole discretion in setting the Rental fees for each Vehicle and will process the Renters credit card, retaining a commission as stated within the mobile App. Fastcarhire will remit such funds the Owner as provided in this section. Fastcarhire will remit payments due to you hereunder no later than 30 days after the end of each successful booking. Payment shall be in the form of bank transfer.
Fastcarhire reserves the right to withhold payment or charge back to your account any amounts otherwise due to us under this Agreement, or any amounts due as a result of a breach of this Agreement by you, pending Fastcarhire's reasonable investigation of such breach.
To ensure proper payment, you are solely responsible for providing and maintaining accurate contact and payment information associated with your account, which includes without limitation applicable tax information. If we believe that we are obligated to obtain tax information and you do not provide this information to us after we have requested it, we may withhold your payments until you provide this information or otherwise satisfy us that you are not a person or entity from whom we are required to obtain tax information.
Any bank fees related to returned or cancelled checks due to a contact or payment information error or omission may be deducted from the newly issued payment. You agree to pay all applicable taxes or charges imposed by any government entity in connection with your participation in the Service. If you dispute any payment made hereunder, you must notify Fastcarhire in writing within thirty (30) days of any such payment; failure to so notify Fastcarhire shall result in the waiver by you of any claim relating to any such disputed payment. Payment shall be calculated solely based on records maintained by Fastcarhire. No other measurements or statistics of any kind shall be accepted by Fastcarhire or have any effect under this Agreement.
Collections. In addition to the amount due, delinquent accounts and/or chargebacks will be charged with fees and/or charges that are incidental to the collection of delinquent accounts and/or chargebacks including, but not limited to, collection fees and/or convenience fees and/or other third parties charges. Members hereby explicitly agree that all communication in relation to delinquent accounts will be made by electronic mail or by phone, as provided to Fastcarhire Inc. by Members. Such communication may be made by Fastcarhire Inc. or by anyone on its behalf, including but not limited to a third party collection agent.
Insurance
Fastcarhire maintains insurance that provides certain coverage to Members for Rentals transacted through the Service. In the event that a Rental in which you participate as a Renter results in a claim covered by the Fastcarhire Insurance, Fastcarhire will make reasonable efforts to assist you in submitting a claim. Fastcarhire does not guarantee the results of any claim submitted for coverage.

At Fastcarhire's request and expense, you will execute documents and take such further acts as Fastcarhire may reasonably request to assist Fastcarhire to acquire, perfect, and maintain its intellectual property rights and other legal protections for the Feedback.
No Agency Clause
Fastcarhire does not appoint you or any other user as its employee, mandatary, legal agent, or form any kind of legal partnership or joint venture. You are not authorized to make any commitments on behalf of Fastcarhire and Fastcarhire will not make commitments on your behalf, except as contemplated by Services or expressly stated in this Agreement.
Copyright Clause
